## Summary:  
A Zeek package for the passive detection of Treck devices, discovery/scanning attempts and exploitation of the "Ripple20" set of vulnerabilities in the Treck TCP/IP stack.

## Notices raised :   

| Notice | Fidelity  |
| -------- | ---------------------- |
|Treck device has been observed based on IP/TTL artifacts - method 1|medium| 
|Treck device has been observed based on IP/TTL artifacts - method 2|medium|
|Treck device has been observed based on TCP artifacts|medium|
|Treck device has been observed based on ICMP artifacts|high|
|The JSOF scanning tool (or derivative) has been observed - method 1|high|
|The JSOF scanning tool (or derivative) has been observed - method 2|high|
|The JSOF scanning tool (or derivative) has been observed - method 3|high|
|Treck IP-in-IP encapsulation exploit outer packet detected|high|
|Treck IP-in-IP encapsulation exploit inner packet detected|high|
|Treck IP-in-IP encapsulation exploit outer and inner packet detected|high|

High Fidelity means high confidence of a True Positive.  
Medium Fidelity means that there could well be False Positives, however if a device has more than one Medium Fidelity notice type, then it is more likely to be a True Positive. For this reason, by default all notices are enabled, however if the medium fidelity notices are too noisy you can disable them with `enable_medium_fidelity_notices = F` in `scripts/config.zeek`.

Where helpful, notices include a small amount of packet metadata which is useful for triage and refinement.

## Usage and recommendations:
- To use against a pcap you already have ```zeek -Cr your.pcap scripts/__load__.zeek```  

- Version (v0.2) additional notices and fully supports clustered OR non clustered live environments.  

- You may also wish to disable Medium Fidelity notices via `enable_medium_fidelity_notices = F` in `scripts/config.zeek` if there is a performance impact bought on by this package. In particular in high Packets per Second environments, for example Internet facing taps where there are a lot of connections including SYN scans, this package uses the connection_established event which will be frequent and expensive in this environment. Disabling the medium fidelity notices will make a large improvement on performance in this case. When installing this package, make sure to profile your system before and after so to ensure that performance isn't an issue for you
